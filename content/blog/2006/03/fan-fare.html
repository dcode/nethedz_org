I've recieved several comments lately indicating that several total strangers really enjoyed reading my blog. I obviously haven't been very active on it since Hurricane Katrina. Sorry about that. So I plan to get back into it. I'm gonna upgrade Wordpress to the latest version, then try to get back into the swing of things.

The thing that changed was my life. Before I was in Germany as an MP. I often had times of self-reflection and observations of the major changes in the lives of others. This provided good subject matter to throw out there. Now I'm a computer geek and don't think about it as much I guess. I'm not sure. Either way, I'll try my best. If it's not good enough, perhaps I'll find another use for this site.

Cheers!
