Okay, so it isn’t exactly a “slashback” because this isn’t [/.][] and this site
doesn’t even run slashcode, but same concept. My mother is doing very well.
Thanks for all your concerns. My grandmother isn’t as fortunate.  She is
currently in the hospital, again. She is not doing so well with her
chemotherapy. I think she will prevail, because she is a very strong woman. All
of us Ditch’s are (well not strong women, but strong all the same). We’re
survivors, it’s what we do. While she was married into the family, she’s been a
part of it for well over 50 years, so that counts.

I now have found an apartment in Rolla, MO where I will resume attendance at
University of Missouri - Rolla. I’ve signed the lease and everything is
official. The only problem is my lease doesn’t begin until June 1st. So…I’m
still technically homeless. I’m still living at the Big K’s house (as noted
[here][]) in cute little Bonnots Mill, MO.

Speaking of Bonnots Mill, MO…Last night there was a chain of thunderstorms
passing through. I think there were 4 different storm systems. The first system
had a tornado that formed right over the lil’ town of Bonnots Mill. It didn’t
touch down, but there was a nice little funnel cloud going. It just decided to
move on down the line and spare us with only some baseball-sized hail.
Yes….baseball sized. And let me tell you, you may have thought you’ve seen some
hail damage before, but some of the dents in the cars around here I could put my
fist in. Anyway, you can see some pics here in my album, once I get them all
uploaded. Satellite internet isn’t quite what I’d call broadband :-.

Peace.
