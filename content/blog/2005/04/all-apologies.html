I know...I know.....it's been over a month since I've written. I kinda have a good
excuse though. I'm still homeless, which is obviously a problem. I'm waiting
for an apartment in Rolla to open up. It should be available on June 1st. For
now, I'm shackin' up at my friends', Kevin and Allyse, house in Bonnots Mill,
MO. It's a quaint lil' town on the Osage River near its mouth on the Missouri
River. It's just south of Jefferson City. 'Tis a bit more in the sticks than I
wanted, but it's a great place to be. I have a lot of fun here from gaming with
Kevin and Allyse and sometimes their neighbor John, to riding four-wheelers
(quads to all you initiated folks), to entertaining Mikey, their 19 month old
son. I get a lot accomplished too. I've gotten my car stereo revamped. It now
was a 4-Channel JL Audio amp powering the door speakers and a nice 500/1 amp
powering two 10 inch Blaupunkt Overdrive subs in the rear. Once I get my income
tax back, I plan to get an alarm system and the rest of the components that I
need to install my car PC. It's gonna be so sweet.  I can't wait.

Other events on the horizon that I can't seem to wait for are Daniela's visit
in June, and further down the road, Defcon 13. This is gonna be one hell of a
summer, whether I go to class or work at state HQ for MO National Guard. This
will definitely be a summer to remember.

That's all for now. I'll try not to be stranger. I just need some time to get
my life in order. Also, by the way, for those of you w/ my cell phone number, I
switched to Cingular Wireless b/c they are innovative and have a nicer coverage
area (although they lack in the competitive pricing and customer service areas
). So if you have Cingular wireless, feel free to call me anytime since it's
free from Cingular to Cingular phone. I'm excitied about that. That's it for
real now. Later.

Peace
