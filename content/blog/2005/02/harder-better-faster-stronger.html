Well, today is an exciting day for me. For multiple reasons, but one of those
reasons is today, I got my 1GB RAM chip for my Powerbook. I now have 1.25 GB of
RAM in my screaming Powerbook w/ OS X 10.3.8. For those of you that are not
techno-geeks, like me, upgrading the RAM means you increase the memory in the
computer. This generally will make your computer better, faster, and stronger;
much like that Daft Punk song. Overall though, RAM upgrades for uber-geeks
like myself, are very exciting.

In other news, and much more important I think, I am in love. And this time she
loves me back, which I think may have been a problem in the past. All love and
more play makes Derek a happy boy. A lot of people will probably think this
makes me less manly or something or that I’ll be “whipped”, but if it makes me
happy, doesn’t that make me more of a man because I know what I want? I would
argue that it does. Feel free to comment and tell me how you feel.
