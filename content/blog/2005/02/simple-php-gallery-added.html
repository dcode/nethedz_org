Thanks to Julian’s comment/link to my previous post, I’ve added an image gallery.
From now on, you will be able to view any of the images that I put into my post
there. You can browse it now, but the formatting is pretty messed up. The
current code doesn’t fit very well with my theme. I’ll continue to hack on it a
bit until I get a reasonably clean interface. For now, just ignore the mess, and
enjoy the pictures.

Who the heck knows? If I get ambitious, I may revamp this code to make it fit
nicer with Wordpress. I thought about doing this before, but neither the code
for Wordpress nor the code for Simple PHP Gallery was mature enough, IMHO. It
would have involved a lot of work. However, the interface and plugin hooks in WP
1.5 are really pretty nice, so who knows? Maybe I will. Maybe I won’t. That’s
the best I can give you.

**UPDATE**: I’ve fixed the image gallery, so enjoy it and perhaps I’ll add some more
photos soon. God knows I’ve got plenty of space for them. I still need to add
descriptions and stuff, but the filenames listed should be pretty well
informative. It would be cool to have a link to all the posts that reference
that particular image when you view the full size image. Hmm….that’s a lot of
work though  . Well for me it’s time to sleep, so: “Gute Nacht, und süße Träume”

Peace.
