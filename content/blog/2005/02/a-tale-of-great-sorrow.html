Today marks a day of great sorrow. Today, am I filled with great sorrow. I,
Derek Ditch, have broken my Powerbook. Now this was not intentional damage. My
foot got snagged on a cord and the Powerbook came crashing down and landed on
its side. Now I've dropped, dented, banged, scratched, and fried this laptop. It
is a bit scarred on the outside, but it still worked like a charm. That is,
until today. For when I picked the Powerbook off the floor, I observed that the
screen was entirely white with a single black line across the bottom. My heart
just dropped.

I decided to do what any computer geek would, take it apart and see what the
problem was. I figured it had something to do with the cable that connects the
display to the main board. This is still my hypothesis, but I have no way to
determine its truth. I did indeed take it apart, but I didn't see any obvious
problems. At this point hope was wisped from my body like smoke from a melting
toy soldier. So I shall pack this laptop with my other belongings and take it to
the Apple store for revival once I return to the states. Curse Apple and their
US only Apple Stores without international shipping! But they're computers are
sexy  .

Here's one last action photo.

If you haven't checked my blog recently, I have added an image gallery where you
can browse to your heart's content all the images have put on my website. Just
click the link at the top of the page that says "photos". You'll figure it out.
I have faith in you.

Peace.
