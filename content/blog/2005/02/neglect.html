Okay, I admit it. You got me. I've been neglectful. I haven't posted here in
nearly two months. Not sure why. I've been off having adventures across Europe
on my days off. I've been to Berlin, London, Stonehenge and of course back to
the Alps. I wouldn't call myself a pro yet, but I'm definitely above a beginner
snowboarder now. Far out, dude. Totally gnarley.

Right, anyway. I was inspired last night when I was at work and just happened to
have my laptop with me, so I typed up the previous entry to this one. It's
really something that I believe strongly about, and I've tried to explain it to
several people, but I just don't know if anyone has ever actually got it. The
very principal is where I feel that I derive much of my strength. It's all just
a matter of faith.

If I stop having crazy, wild adventures for a day and become not-lazy, then I'll
post some pics of the things I've done and places that I've visited since
Christmas. Stay tuned and I'll try not be be neglectful for a while. 

Peace.
