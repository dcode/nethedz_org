Last night we celebrated the last night of Julian as a bachelor. We had a grand
'ole time and got good and liquored up. May these times not end, but evolve into
the next stages of our lives where we won't forget to have fun and continue to
take care of and love each other as an undeniable and undefeatable friendship.

>  Julian, even though I'm not your best man, and I don't get to give a toast,  
>  I offer you this bit of space to be recorded,  
>  for as long as the Internet is alive,  
>  but not as long as your love shall thrive,  
>  that I never expected you to be the first,  
>  but it seems that you found the best.  
>  And that's what I wish for you, only the best.  
>   
>   
>  Congratulations Julian and Addrienne.
