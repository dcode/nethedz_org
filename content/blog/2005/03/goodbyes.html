Over the next couple of weeks, I will be moving from Germany back to the states.
There's a lot of Army crap that has to be taken care of, which will take most of
my time. Also, I may not have access to a computer very often, thus I may not
make entries here in my blog or respond to e-mails very quickly.

In other regretfull news, my mother has been hospitalized for Congested Heart
Failure (CHF). I'm not sure what that all means, but it's not something to have
a party over I'm sure. My unit here in Germany is trying to get me home as soon
as possible so I can be with her. All I know about it is, she has been feeling
light-headed and short of breath. She apparently has an irregular or unstable
heartbeat due to permanently damaged tissue in her heart as well. Please keep
her in your prayers that she recovers quickly and can fix the main problem so
she can continue to have a long a healthy life.

Thank you and I wish you peace.
