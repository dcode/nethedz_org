Just a quick update for all of you. My mother is home from the hospital and
she's feeling much better. She's quit smoking and she's also on several
medications. She still has to take it easy, but her health is still improving.
Thanks to all of you that were praying for her.

I also visited my grandmother today. She's going through chemo-therapy for
cancer in her lymph nodes. She looked a lot better that I would have thought
after two chemo treatments. Please keep her in your prayers too, that she can
defeat this cancer and stay strong.

On a lighter note, my laptop should be completely repaired by the end of this
week. The bad news about that is it cost me my arm up to about my elbow, and my
left leg about half-way up the shin.   When I get it back it will be almost
indistinguishable from a brand new Powerbook though. I'm looking forward to
that.

If anyone know of any good real estate in Rolla for purchase or rent/lease,
please let me know. I'm currently homeless and looking to solve that issue.
Thanks.

Peace.
