I have now begun my venture to conquer yet another eXtreme sport. I'm taking eXtreme Ditch to the next level. I, of course, have begun my quest to be a champion wakeboarder. So far, my skills are behind my buddy Dave's, but then again, I've only tried it for a couple of hours and the bindings were a size too small for my feet (ouch!). For those of you unaquainted with my eXtreme skillz, they started with my aggressive inline skating, then progressing to my thrashing of the Alpine slopes in my snowboard. I'll post some pics of those perfomances when I find em (long story). Until then, you may see what I currently have in my brand spankin' new eXtreme D! photo album.

Peace, D
