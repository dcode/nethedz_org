I've recently started digging back into my research after taking about a year's
hiatus. Much of my research is concerned with Cyber-Physical Systems, which can
be often modelled as graphs or multi-graphs.

In the past, I've used Matlab and built an adjacency matrix to model my graphs,
however it's high-time that I kick the expensive software suites and up my
productivity by using a more general purpose language. This will enable me to
build custom GUIs, interact with the actual software tools that I use in
application of my work, and I don't have to worry about licensing.

Graph Tool
-----------------
So, right before my break, I took a course in Internet data
searching...something or other. My semester project for that class involved the
creation of a system that would allow multi-level graph searching. Think Google
with type specific queries. I used [IMDB][imdb] as my data set and a
[Python][python] library called [graph-tool][] for storing the data. The gist of
the project would allow you to perform searches such as "a film or play in the
90s that contained an actor (or actress) that also appeared in the movie Star 
Wars: A New Hope". There's very specific type information in that query that you
cannot achieve by simply submitting a keyword search.

The long and short of it is that I used graph-tool to store and process this
data. `graph-tool` is basically a Python wrapper around the [Boost Graph
Library][bgl] (BGL) that implements some additional algorithms and interfaces with
other tools. Why this is so nice is that Boost libraries are written in C++,
which is both fast and familiar to me. The BGL is well-known in the scientific
and mathematic community for it's performance and completeness. Since I am also
quite fond of Python for rapid development and overall scripting and glue code,
graph-tool is seemingly a good choice for me. There are certainly other
noteworthy Python graph libraries out there, but this post isn't about them.
I've used NetworkX, igraph, and a few others. `graph-tool` is my choice.

How to Install on Mac OS X 10.6
---------------------------------
Day to day I use a newer (not the newest) MacBook Pro. As such, I needed to
install graph-tool on Mac OS X. I also have a laptop running Fedora 15, but
installing this on that platform is quite trivial.

For many open-source tools I've come to like the [Homebrew][brew] tool. It has a
fun name and it also keeps things cleanly separated from the OS. It's also quite
active. Go to the project page and find how easy it is to install.

`graph-tool` has the following pre-requisites:

 - GCC 4.2 or above (install the Mac OS X Developer Tools)
 - boost 1.42 or above (`sudo brew install boost` will install 1.46.1 as of
 today)
 - Python 2.5 or above (2.6 is built-in)
 - expat library (built-in)
 - SciPy (I installed numpy first, then `pip install scipy`)
 - numpy (`pip install numpy`)
 - CGal 5 or above - I'm not really sure about this since the latest version is
 3.8 (`brew install cgal` - make sure you install boost first)
 - graphviz (`brew install graphviz`)

*NOTE:* before installing any Python modules I _highly_ suggest using
virtualenv. I covered this in a [previous post][virtualenv], please go read to
learn more. It will save you some hair pulling.

I created a brew recipe for this by doing the following (or just download it
from link below)

    :::bash
    sudo brew create http://downloads.skewed.de/graph-tool/graph-tool-2.2.14.tar.bz2
    sudo brew edit graph-tool

Make it match the following:

    :::ruby
    require 'formula'
    
    class GraphTool < Formula
      url 'http://downloads.skewed.de/graph-tool/graph-tool-2.2.14.tar.bz2'
      homepage 'http://projects.skewed.de/graph-tool/'
      md5 '13b8738a66cdd9e027e38a45b4123da8'

      depends_on 'boost'
      depends_on 'scipy' => :python
      depends_on 'numpy' => :python
      depends_on 'cgal'

      def install
        system "./configure", "--disable-debug", "--disable-dependency-tracking",
                              "--prefix=#{prefix}"
        # system "cmake . #{std_cmake_parameters}"
        system "make install"
      end
    end


Then you can just do `sudo brew install graph-tool`. Now is a good time to take
a nap, go for a walk, drink a beer, etc. Graph Tool authors explicitly state on
the project homepage that since this uses C++ templates, there is *A LOT* of
overhead on the compilation. It may take upto 1GB of RAM to compile this. The
final product is quite optimized and only takes about about 20MB of hard drive
space. If you need to tune this to use less RAM, check out the options on their
website.

For reference, my compilation on my MacBook Pro with 2.66 GHz Core i7 and 8GB of
RAM took 5 hours and 59.5 minutes. Ouch.

Finish Up
--------------
Well, that's it. `graph-tool` is now installed and is ready to use. Go ahead and
head on over to the [graph-tool][] website and read the tutorials, examples, and
quick start. You can start toying by firing up `ipython` and running

    :::python
    from graph_tool.all import *
    
    g = Graph()
    v1 = g.add_vertex()
    v2 = g.add_vertex()
    e = g.add_edge(v1, v2)
    graph_draw(g, vprops={"label": g.vertex_index}, output="two-nodes.png")
