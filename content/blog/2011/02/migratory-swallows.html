I've been flying under the Internet radar for some time. A lot has happened
since the last time that I was actively blogging. That was back in...oh... 
2005 was the peak, I guess. At the time, my blog was hosted on Wordpress 1.5
over on derek.ditch.name. You can still see some remants of it over at the
Wayback Machine.

But I digress...

*This* post is about my migration to [Fedora][]. I have long since avoided 
all RPM-based distros due primarily to RPM dependency-hell. Well, 
Fedora/Redhat has actually implemented a package manager these days, 
called `yum`. Yum has pretty much eliminated this issue. I determined it 
was worth taking a looksee.

My History with Ubuntu
-----------------------

Ubuntu and I go way back..pretty much to the beginning. I started using
[Ubuntu][] in the Warty Warthog release (4.10). I requested a hard copy disk
of the installation to play with.

Really, our relationship goes back even further. I started messing 
seriously with Linux as my primary operating system in 2000 with 
[Debian][] 2.2. I could barely get [X][] to run on my laptop at the time, 
but by God, I was running Linux.

Time to Move On
------------------------

The beginning of the turning point for me, was likely the release of KDE 4.
I *like* [Qt][]. This is likely a result of my being a C++ developer. I say
C++, but really I develop in many languages. C++ is just the language that
I was taught at [school][]. It is also the primary language that is used in
the research projects that I participate in. I attempted to learn Qt back
in the Qt 3 days, but I was horrified. It was basically just a bunch of
hacks. One could argue that Qt 4 is no different, but actual C++ code is
used for much of the interaction instead of the solely macro-based
signal-slot mechanism. That's a long way to get around that, I liked KDE4
when it was released.

The problem with this affinity, is that [Kubuntu][], the KDE brother to
Ubuntu is a second-class citizen. For most Ubuntu releases, I would install
the Gnome version and then the KDE version. The KDE version was always less
polished and things just plain wouldn't work. On my Thinkpad, for instance,
the media keys would work very nicely in Gnome, but in KDE they wouldn't
work at all and required significant work to get them working in the same
ballpark as Gnome.

Now, some of this was due to the immaturity of KDE at the time. But a lot
wasn't. I usually just accepted this, but it had a bad taste in my mouth.

A New Hope
------------------------

Recently, I've been doing a lot of security work, mostly in the Information
Assurance realm. A great resource for hardening operating systems (and
other software/hardware) are the [Security Guides] published by the
NSA. Now for Linux, the only guide they have is for RedHat Enterprise Linux
5. The reason they support RedHat are obvious:

 * RedHat has been around as an enterprise platform for a long time.
 * Official development platform of NSA SELinux
 * The platform aims to be somewhat hardened out of the box.

The last point is my perception and not necessarily statement of fact.
Since I am merely a student and not looking to pay for enterprise-grade
support, I took a look at the Fedora Project, RedHat's bleeding edge,
community-driven playground. I liked that Fedora had SELinux policies for
just about everything and has that same security-hardened focus of RHEL. 

I first downloaded the KDE variant and installed it. I was quite pleased at
its level of polish. Then, just to see what I was missing out on (if
anything), I installed the Gnome variant, which is the official *spin* of
Fedora. Surprisingly, it was about the same level of as the KDE spin. After
digging into more documentation, I found future plans for Gnome 3.

Then I started reading about Gnome 3 and the sweet Gnome Shell. I liked
what I saw. I found that the Gnome Shell was packaged in the Fedora yum
repositories and installed it. For a desktop, it's quite slick indeed. I
think there's some room for improvement, but it's a very usable, modern
desktop with the same level of maturity and integration of Gnome 2. The
pleasantness of Gnome is just that: the maturity. This is probably due to
the fact that enterprise-grade companies have adopted Gnome as the official
platform and added to it in terms of accessibility and human interface
guidelines.

Wrap it Up
------------
So...this was all a long way to get around to my logic for looking at
Fedora and being pleased with what I found. After some tweaking, I made yum
not suck so much. Mainly, I turned on caching so that I didn't have to
download a new index *every **damn** time* that I want to query the package
manager.
