I rewrote this site, as I have been doing regularly for the past 5 or 6 years
on the interval of about 9 months. I read some pretty convincing arguments
for static site generation. I don't know where, exactly, but I read somewhere
about [Hyde][], a static site generator. 

This entry aims to give a brief overview for my decision.

The Recurring Problem
-----------------------

While I don't always follow this mantra, it's generally a good idea to not
fix a problem that doesn't exist. This has led me to the triquarterly redesign
of my site to try the latest, greatest framework.

I started out my blogging days using Wordpress....nay...it goes back further
than that. My friend [Julian][] and I had an old Geocities site under our
psuedonyms Kalvyn and Hobbbz. And this was well before they had the cute little
inline WSYWYG editor. There was a textbox that loaded the HTML (3) for your
page where you could edit it, unassisted. They would then use [SSI][] to 
insert ads into your page.

So, the next way forward was using Wordpress. I enjoyed hacking on the
internals, too. I helped port Wordpress 1.5 into [WPMU], the multi-user
edition which has been incorporated into the mainline Wordpress and runs
[Wordpress.com][].

I then drifted away from PHP and picked up Python. I started hacking on
Python CGI-based sites then picked up [Django][]. The problem with Django,
was that it was all roll-your-own. The problem being that I spent all my time
hacking on my website rather than writing anything.

The Crux
--------------

Herein, lies the problem. I want a website that doesn't get in my way. Another
problem is that my data gets locked away in these databases.
