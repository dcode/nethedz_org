I rewrote this site, as I have been doing regularly for the past 5 or 6 years
on the interval of about 9 months. I read some pretty convincing arguments
for static site generation. I don't know where, exactly, but I read somewhere
about [Hyde][], a static site generator. 

This entry aims to give a brief overview for my decision.

The Recurring Problem
-----------------------

While I don't always follow this mantra, it's generally a good idea to not
fix a problem that doesn't exist. This has led me to the triquarterly redesign
of my site to try the latest, greatest framework.

I started out my blogging days using Wordpress....nay...it goes back further
than that. My friend [Julian][] and I had an old Geocities site under our
psuedonyms Kalvyn and Hobbbz. And this was well before they had the cute little
inline WSYWYG editor. There was a textbox that loaded the HTML (3) for your
page where you could edit it, unassisted. They would then use [SSI][] to 
insert ads into your page.

So, the next way forward was using Wordpress. I enjoyed hacking on the
internals, too. I helped port Wordpress 1.5 into [WPMU], the multi-user
edition which has been incorporated into the mainline Wordpress and runs
[Wordpress.com][].

I then drifted away from PHP and picked up Python. I started hacking on
Python CGI-based sites then picked up [Django][]. The problem with Django,
was that it was all roll-your-own. The problem being that I spent all my time
hacking on my website rather than writing anything. This was to add features,
to keep up with the development cycles of other projects that I used, and
to make sure my site didn't get hacked by some script kiddies.

The Crux
--------------

Herein, lies the problem. I want a website that doesn't get in my way. Another
problem is that my data gets locked away in these databases. Hence, my attraction
to Hyde. 

I've had blogs that have died due to my poor coding and the server just
stopped running randomly. I've had blogs quit because the webhost upgraded
the database and the development branch code I was using didn't support
the new data engine. I've had blogs die because I crossed the memory threshold
that I pay for on my webhost. And the last webblog I had died because
the community died. I needed fixes for core parts of the code and it never
came, thus the hacks I added to make them, caused it to break. I didn't 
want to dig through and rewrite the whole damn thing.

The Solution
---------------
With Hyde:

 - All my content lies in flatfiles
 - I use GitHub for backing it up
 - Extending functionality uses something that I already know (Django)
 - Minimal upkeep (I can clone the git repo and build it quickly)
 - Just Simple
    - No server side processes to break
    - No database server to break
    - No worries about when my webhost does database upgrades
    - No worries about approaching my memory quota on my server
    - Basically, slashdot-proof.
 
Overall, the structure and workflow is just more robust and I like it. Even
if Hyde suffered stagnation and the community died, all my content is stored
in version controlled flat files that I can easily parse using a couple of
lines of Python (or even Perl or PHP for that matter).

I wrote this entry in two sessions. I may have had more on my mind for the 
first session, but this is where I ended up. I may come back later and add
more. Or even better, I'll mark a cross-referenced page. See my [To Do][]
for this site on the [project][] page.
