Over the past week, I delved into the Internet Archive's [Wayback Machine][]
in an attempt to resurrect content from my old site. In the height of my
blogging days, I used early versions of [Wordpress][]. As I matured in my
programming skills, I moved away from PHP (full story [here][back-to-basics]).

While rebuilding this site using [Hyde][], I decided one of the features
I wanted in reclaiming my content, was to bring in my old content from way
back. I still have the tarball file that I dumped from the MySQL database
including images and everything somewhere. I would prefer to go this route.
And I'm not quite ruling it out if I ever happen to locate it. It should
be rather straight forwards since I wrote those posts using the original
PHP Markdown syntax.

My initial attempts at finding that file failed, however. I have two old
computers that have various archives of my past on them. These archives
range from giant MP3 collections, my long-lost DVD library in AVI format,
probably ISOs of Linux distributions that no longer exist, and of course,
my web presence. I have been known from time to time to be a packrat...even
a digital packrat.

I have since reaped the content from the Wayback Machine and manually pasted
it into Markdown-formatted files. It is now revision controlled with the rest
of this site, hopefully to live forever and ever, with me in control of it.

I have (or will) deactivate comments on those pages and put a little
notice at the top indicating that it is there for posterity only, and not
interactive.
