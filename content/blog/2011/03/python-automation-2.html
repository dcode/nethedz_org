In my [last post][] I described some of the initial magic that I use to automate
this site. That initial magic is using virtual python environments through the
use of *virtualenv* and *virtualenvwrapper*. See that post for more.

In this post, I'm gonna describe a more general purpose tool that allows
automation through Python scripts across hosts, Fabric.

Fabric
-------------

[Fabric][] has got to be one of the greatest Python tools I've come across
in a long time. I've written similar code that used an XML-RPC mechanism,
but Fabric does it right. And I'm really glad I found it when I did. I was
actually starting to work on something very similar from the ground up
for my own usage.
