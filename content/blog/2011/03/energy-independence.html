Something that I've come at odds with my friends about many times is the subject
of alternative energy. My left-wing nut job friends think that I'm overly
conservative and should open my mind to the global economy panacea. On the other
hand, my right-wing nut job friends think that I've been exposed to the
left-winged for far too long at university and that I've been brainwashed.

So, obviously the hippies want to protect Mother Earth and stop polluting. Not
that I'm for polluting, but it's no so much about about saving the environment
that has me concerned for America's energy.

Rise and Fall of an Economy
-----------------------------

America's economic rising happened around the turn of the 20th century due to
the wide adoption of the railroad, mass production of the automobile, and
getting back on our feet after the Civil War. While the U.S. Government spent way
more money than they ever had in building our national railroad infrastructure,
the return on that investment was that it was now (relatively) quick to get gold
out of the Rockies, textiles out of the South, and cars out of the North. The
key here is that spent the  money on infrastructure.

Fast forward to present day. While the U.S. is still a major economic power,
what do we give to the world to make us so? We're number one in research,
medicine, technological development and online commerce. Meanwhile, we outsource
the labor to build and implement the fruits of our research and development to
other countries because...it's cheaper. I understand the idea of outsourcing,
but I think it's dangerous to the extent to which we've done it. I mean, it's
more profitable to build elsewhere and ship to the U.S., the world's largest
consumers....or it was.

With rising oil prices, the cost of transportation of goods around the world and
around the country is rapidly increasing. That cost is past on to the consumer,
where it always goes. The cost of living goes up and our service-based jobs have
to pay more to keep us afloat. The problem with a service-based economy, which
we have certainly become, is that there's no tangible goods to hold value. There
is a tipping point where it is worth it to me to learn how to do your job rather
than paying you to do it for me. Take into account the multitude of programs
that brings in students from around the world, trains them in schools and
internships, and then sends them home to build a business there. Now, in
addition to outsourcing our manufacturing and labor, we can hire someone in
India, or where ever to perform our services for cheaper.

Well, if we are outsourcing our service-based economy, where does that leave
us?

A New Economy
-------------------

In my research as a computer scientist, I've worked a lot on projects funded by
the Department of Energy. Much of the research is for energy reliability.
Recently with all the buzz of "Green Energy", I've been working on a project to
develop self-sustaining "micro-powergrids". These grids are like neighborhood
level. Everybody is happy and whistles as they go to work and share energy with
their neighbor in a very "Leave it to Beaver" type of world.

Now, the target for this type of research is sensible. It's actually designed to
provide reliable power to third-world countries like some of those in Africa
which do not have electricity all the time, or even most of the time. In these
types of scenarios, it makes sense to pay the overhead of "free", renewable
energy because it's cheaper than importing coal or maintaining a national power
grid. These renewable energy systems do not make sense for the United States
because we already have a national power grid in place, we already have coal and
nuclear power, and *alternative energy* is currently extremely expensive.

Here's where my right-wing nut Job friends stop listening to my argument. I think
we could continue to research and develop alternative energy solutions. We
should stop dumping all our money into foreign oil. Right now, we're friendly
with many nations, or at least economically advantageous for them to work with
us. The Middle East is an incredibly unstable political arena. Why the hell
would we want to make that as our primary energy source? You have the oil
companies in the Middle East that are jacking up the cost of oil
because...well..who knows why they do it. Maybe because they can and it makes
them richer. Maybe it's because the political turmoil increases their operating
costs. Maybe it's a combination or something completely different.

If the U.S. economy can get off of our dependence on foreign oil, it gives us a
multitude of benefits:

- More jobs
- A stronger economy because we have a new industry to compete in: energy
- A stronger national defense
- A cleaner environment

Bringing a focus on energy in the United States will mean increased research in
our top-notch universities. We get workers skilled in engineering tomorrow's
energy systems. These energy systems, when renewable, we can sell to other
countries so that they can work towards a "greener" planet. Mass production of
anything makes it cheaper, so we can lower the cost of renewable energy
eventually. Who knows, maybe researchers will figure out how to make a warp
drive and we can build a whole Federation Fleet (nerd reference to Star Trek,
here). In addition to the skilled engineers, we also get the blue collar workers that
run the industry.

So that covers the first two bullets. A stronger national defense is really what
I'm concerned about and I think is our best reason for doing this. Foreign
energy markets are unstable. The more we rely on them, the more we put ourselves
in a dangerous position. Those who fail to remember lessons of history are
doomed to repeat it. Germany lost the war not because of our superior tactics
and weaponry. They had us beat on that. They lost the war because they ran out
of resources.

Anyone that has every played StarCraft or Command and Conquer
knows that when you run out of minerals, oil, or gold, you're screwed until you
can find another place to harvest. If we went to war, or one of our allies went
to war with Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, or wherever we buy all our oil...we get
stuck up the proverbial creek without a paddle. We have enough oil reserve to
meet our daily demand for 30 days. We **cannot** build our off-shore drilling
infrastructure in 30 days.

It Won't Work
-----------------

So how are we supposed to reach this panacea of cheap energy? We use *our*
national resources. As the right-wingers will happily point out, we have enough
oil reserves in the U.S. to last us thousands of years. The Midwest also
flourishes with cheap electricity thanks to readily available coal. Using that
to keep the cost low, we can continue energy research to make "Green" energy
cheaper.

Flat out, it doesn't make sense for our entire society (in the US) to jump to
wind generators, solar, and geothermal energy. It just isn't possible with the
current related costs. The government gives subsidies to make it affordable for
the consumer, but that isn't sustainable and won't make a difference in the
industry. The big players are industrial uses of energy.  

There is **great** value in cutting our oil consumption to the point that we 
can provide for ourselves, however. Reducing our dependence on foreign energy
sources ensures that we won't get the carpet yanked from beneath us in time of
crisis.

Finally, continuing and increasing research in energy will take us to the next
competitive industry. We will, once again, be able to export durable goods and
strengthen the U.S. economy, while making energy cheaper for ourselves.

UPDATE: I've seen several commercials in the last couple of days pushing energy
independence through natural gas, which is something that I didn't include above.
I do think that coal is cheap enough, even with restrictive systems to make it
"clean", to make a great electrical power source and fuel for vehicles like
trains. Which is a whole different rant. I think we are drastically
under-utilizing our railroad system. It is outdated, agreed, but some
infrastructure improvement here would go a long way.
