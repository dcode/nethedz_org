Just a quick note on the impending release of the [ISO C++ 2011][] specification. It
gets a lot of flack from the hipsters that are into the new age, high-level
languages like [Go], [Python], or even [Java]. The thing is, C++ isn't these
languages. I use Python for tons of stuff. I prefer Python for a
rapid-development platform and things like web development. I use Python for
[this site][].

C++ is, in my humble opinion, a great low/medium level programming language.
It's like Genie from Aladdin: [phenomenal cosmic power, ity bity living
space][genie]. 

It's lean and mean, but gives you the convenience to do things elegantly when
you so desire. Now, I may be biased, after all, I learned the core of Computer
Science using C++ as my required tool. On the other hand, prior to learning C++,
I learned Java, and before that BASIC then Visual Basic.

C++ gets a bad rap because people say that it's clunky and bloated compared to C
and it's way more easy to shoot yourself in the foot than using something like
Java or Python. All of that is true. However, just because Java and Python will
clean up your mess with garbage collection and such, that's no excuse for lousy
programmers that can't do a good design. And with C, the thing is, C++ allows
you to use programming methodologies that reflect the real world. That is,
create C++ classes that model real objects that can do stuff and respond to
events.

My take is that if C++ developers wrote code that follows the [Boost][] and/or
[Qt][] ideologies, these safety problems go away. You're left with a lean,
mean, non-platform specific program that can clean up after itself and get the
job done with a reasonable expectation of safety and security...but I'm writing a
paper on those topics, so I'll leave that for another blog post.

Cheers.
