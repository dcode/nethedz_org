In a [previous post][] I described some of the initial magic that I use to automate
this site. That initial magic is using virtual python environments through the
use of *virtualenv* and *virtualenvwrapper*. See that post for more.

In this post, I'm gonna describe a more general purpose tool that allows
automation through Python scripts across hosts, Fabric.

[TOC]

Fabric
-------------

[Fabric][] has got to be one of the greatest Python tools I've come across
in a long time. I've written similar code that used an XML-RPC mechanism,
but Fabric does it right. And I'm really glad I found it when I did. I was
actually starting to work on something very similar from the ground up
for my own usage.

What Fabric provides for me in the context of authoring this website is
automated build and publishing capability. In the most general sense, Fabric
provides a way to script administrative tasks on local and remote machine(s)
using a local Python script.

It performs these actions using SSH, rsync, some UNIX shell utilities like sed,
and even some Django integration for some backend automation. I've certainly
seen most usage of Fabric used in conjunction with website management, but I'm
working on some scripts that will provide some administrative functionality for
managing routers and switches over SSH -- things like pulling configs, running
stats, and pushing quick fixes like a logging server change.

Example
--------------

So I'll run through just the simple script that this site currently uses. The
heart of any Fabric deployment is the `fabfile.py`. The command on your path
that you use is `fab`. `fab` travels up the directory tree until it finds a
fabfile that it can use. While I use a flat `fabfile.py` Python module, you can
also use a `fabfile/` directory containing an `__init__.py` file. Optionally,
you can point `fab` to any other Python module.

So `fab` will import your fabfile and generate a list of tasks to perform. These
tasks have certain properties that you can modify on the command line. One
property is the hosts. Fabric will run each specified task on each host
specified in `env.hosts`, which is a Python list of host strings. A host string
contains a username and host definition (optionally a port number). An example is `user@www.example.com` or
`author@10.10.10.10:22`.
