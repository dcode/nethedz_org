Today I tried to add some content. In doing so, I wanted to upgrade Fabric to
get some additional features. I took a blind leap of faith and just wiped out my
virtualenv and just tried to reinstall. Incidentally, the hyde branch that I had
been following no longer exists, and so I chased my tail trying to figure out
why the hell I couldn't pull the latest.

So, I've been forced to upgrade to the latest hyde. I don't know what that means
yet, hopefully this site will continue to generate and I can clean it up with
Jinja2 templates over time. I might lose some features in the short term, but
the new Hyde includes several niceties such as tags (which I've been wanting to
do for a while) and some optimization stuff. On top of that, I like Jinja2
templates better than the built-in Django templating engine. Just a bit cleaner
and less bloat since I don't need the whole Django ORM.

**EDIT**: As it turns out, this was a beast to do, so it's getting shelved and I
will revert to a virtualenv that I have on another machine until I can sort this
out. \**grumble grumble*\*
