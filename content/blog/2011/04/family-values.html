I've been listening to [Dave Ramsey]'s Financial Peace University (military
edition, specifically) on my drives to and from work. I'm only a couple of
lessons in, but I have to say that it's very thought provoking.

Aside from the good financial advice that he is known for, he's also very
entertaining. And while it's not overbearing, he often quotes the Bible because
he relates his financial advice to quality Christian values. I appreciate that.
That's not to say that it should turn anyone off if they're not into the whole
Christian thing. Certainly you can admit that many religions have many good
values and just because it isn't your religion doesn't mean that it has no
value. But I am a Christian, and a Catholic one at that, and I appreciate his
values...but I digress.

He talks about teaching your kids how to manage money. He says that with his
kids instead of an *allowance*, he implemented a *commission*. Each chore in the
house is associated with a dollar amount and his children **earn** their
*allowance*. Personally, I think this is a great idea. I had an allowance
growing up, but if I didn't do my chores, it went away. All or nothing. This is
a good balance, I think. It teaches that you have to work for your money *AND*
you should spend it wisely because if all your allowance is gone, you have to
work for more.

Since I became a father 4 months ago, I've been thinking a lot about instilling
good values in my children, not spoiling them, and setting them up for success
in their adult lives. I take notice of how other people manage and raise their
kids from when I'm out at the store and see interactions, to some light reading
online. You'll notice in my Blogroll at the bottom of each page that I include a
link to [Gerry LaMontagne]'s blog. I find many of his entries to be thought
provoking and quite entertaining.

I don't know if this post has added any coherent value or just ramblings, but I
had some thoughts and wanted to record them.

Thanks for reading.
