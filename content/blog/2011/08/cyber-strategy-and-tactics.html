A problem that is faced today by the United States, and almost every other world
power is how to defend in the new age of information superiority as it relates
to military conflict, in particular. How does a nation define an information
operation as a military act and more importantly, how do you methodically defend
against such attacks, disruptions, and infiltrations?

I've been reading a recent publication titled "[Cyber Infrastructure
Protection][CIP]", published by the Strategic Studies Institute. It describes
cyber infrastructure using the operational model of tactics, operations, and
strategy. The authors define the base level as cyberspace. Layered on top of
cyberspace for operations is cyberpower. Layered on top of cyberpower is
cyberstrategy. 

The gist for those readers without a military background is basically cyberspace
is the tactical realm, where individuals or teams conduct some sort of action,
whether it be defensive, offensive, or just everyday business and commerce.
Cyberpower is the collection of these tactical actions that work towards some
operational goal. That goal something specific like remove and prevent access to
all hactivist groups. The cyberstrategy level is a big-picture type of concept
that is supported by one or more operations by exhibiting cyberpower. Note that
this is merely my interpretation and not specific definitions from the book.

Moving along...

I often like to take current problems and attepmt to map previously learned
techniques, tactics, and procedures (TTPs) with a slight modification in
implementation. In this way, it allows me to continue to think in a familiar
way, but apply it to a new problem.

For this problem, it seems defense is conceptually the same as in other tactical
scenarios. Specifically, you set a perimeter defense and scan your sector, which
overlaps with your buddy's sector and watch for anything out of the ordinary.
While I've actually implemented this without thinking about it, it was difficult
for me to describe how to effectively defend against attack.

Obviously we're not setup in a 360-degree perimter with overlapping sectors of
fire, because we are operating in cyberspace. Therefore, we have to have a
cyber-360, so to speak. On my team, we all have the same basic skills and
cross-train and share knowledge. However, there are those of us who are more
interested and knowledgable in firewalls, for instance. Or Windows servers, or
UNIX boxes. Having some sort of heads-up display monitoring these systems and
their connections to the outside world provides that 360 perimeter. These
sectors overlap implicitly due to the inherent nature of the OSI model.
Odd network connections to the Exchange server can be seen from the firewall and
switch levels, as well.

This is where team tactics come in. What has made my team successful in
exercises in the past has been that we understand these overlaps and implicitly
share that information to the corresponding systems and team members.

Has anyone read or seen these team-level tactics used in cyber defense? If so,
could you give me a link to read more?

That's all for now.
