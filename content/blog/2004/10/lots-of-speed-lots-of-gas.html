Today I slept until 11:40am. It was grand. I went to the A5 last night. That's a
club here in Darmstadt. It's the coolest club I've ever been in. It's got two
dance floors, 5 bars, and a pub area. Last night was the "American Party" night
so on one floor they were playing R&B/Hip-Hop. That's alright, but it's not
really my style. Germans don't bump 'n grind either. Which is fine because I
don't really like all that anyhow. I spent most of my time on the Techno floor.
I love techno and it's great. Before I started dancing, I was upstairs in the
big bar with my buddies Travis and Jon. We had a few drinks and just chit
chatted. Then we went downstairs and I went to the dance floor. Travis and Jon
preferred to just sit on the side and watch. Which is cool. Travis did say that
he could show me up on the floor, but he doesn't have the courage yet. I'm
waiting for him to present his challenge. If he is better, great. I enjoy a good
show.

I was dancing for a while, just kinda out there with the Germans having a good
time. Then....they began to play Maria by Scooter. This is an awesome song. I
broke out the lights. Oh yeah. Unfortunately, one of my lights came unscrewed
somehow in my pocket and the batteries flew everywhere. Without missing a beat,
I put that one back in my pocket and just danced with one light. The Germans
seemed impressed....or maybe there were making fun of me....whatever....the important
part is, I was having a great time. I don't know if I'm a good dancer. For all I
know, I could be an absolute abomination to the dance floor. But I enjoy myself,
and that's good enough for me.

Today, I did some laundry, and I made my first pot of chili. I thought it was
delicious. My roommates seemed to like it. I'm gonna make some more the next day I'm
off. The only issue with that is, we are three rather flatulent guys....we eat a
pot of chili, sit on the couch and watch movies, with the door shut. Not a good
combination. :-\

This evening, we went to go ride GoKarts. This was great. These gokarts were the
fastest I've ever seen. We had to wear helmets, but the german gokarts don't
have seatbelts. These carts go around 46km/hr. That's like 30 mph for you
non-metric people out there. That's pretty quick in a little rickety piece of
metal when other people are wizzing by you and slamming into you. It was a great
time. We all raced for 20 minutes straight on this windy track with 2 pretty
long straight-aways.

Overall, this was a good day off. I enjoyed it. K, I gotta shine my boots and
write some code.

Peace.
