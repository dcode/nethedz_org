As of today, the curse of Babe Ruth on the Red Sox is over, much to my dismay. I
would have really liked to see my Cardinals win, but perhaps it is for the best.
This way, the next time they go to the World Series, I’ll be able to go to their
games. It sucked over here in Germany, because the games were aired between 1 am
and 3 am. Seeing as how I get up between 4:30 am and 5:00 am, I couldn’t exactly
watch all of them. The Cards did really well this season, regardless of the
outcome. I am still a 100% supporter of them, as I have always been, and always
will be.

My best buddy in the whole world will be getting married in May. I shall make a
stunning appearance at the wedding. I don’t really know what that means yet, but
I’m sure it will be spectacular. The wedding…..not my appearance.  More to come
on that.

I’ve been playing a lot of racquetball lately. I go play racquetball and workout
between games. It’s a good time and until I find a nice indoor skate park and
some new skates, I’m going to have to settle for it. I take this sport to the
exteme too. I just wish I could post some video footage of me on here. *sigh*
Perhaps someday I shall get a Digital Video Cam. Hmm…..can you say….WishList?
*Yay!*

I’ve been pretty busy lately and haven’t had time to write any code for
anything. I’ve gotten Wordpress to a likeable state for myself, with the only
feature left that I desire is a nice clean photo gallery plugin. I started
working on one, but then got distracted with MultiSite (which btw I haven’t
gotten any feedback on — If you have played with it, I would appreciate
comments). If nothing further develops with Wordpress that interests me, I’m
going to start playing with the Mono development framework or perhaps I’ll
tinker with Qt again. I don’t know yet. I’ve got a couple of ideas that I’d like
to explore, but we’ll see where time takes me. Next month I’ll be on midnight
shift and will probably have a lot of free time.  I love free time.

That’s about it for now. Also, for those of you that care, I’ve added more
things to my wishlist. Go ahead and check it out. It might give you ideas of
some gadgets that you’d like. Enjoy!

Peace.
