I’m kinda struggling here recently. I’m sorry I haven’t posted more personal and
entertaining thoughts here. I’ve just been really busy. I’m supposed to get a
pic of my via e-mail from my first real attempt at snow boarding. I will share
that with you as soon as I get it (should be Tuesday or so). Also, I really want
to get some advice from all you out there on some other stuff, so stay tuned.

Peace.
