I have been deployed to Germany for 12 months now. Since I have been here, I
have worked as a military police officer on a very wide range of cases. I've
done everything from simple speeding and parking tickets, to rape, suicidide,
and now attempted murder. In addition to this, I've been away from my friends
and family...those people that I really love. With all of these experiences, I've
learned a lot about life in general, at least as I see it now as a near 23
year-old.

When Horace said "[Carpe Diem][]", I think he was absolutely right. Since I've
seperated from my family and friends, I have realized that I have missed several
opportunities to let someone know that I appreciate them. I was always told that
my number one priority in life was to get an education and nothing was to get in
the way. I now understand that an education is number two. Number one is to love
one another. Love humanity and care for all of them. Being a police officer, I
have been able to do that on a daily basis. My job here is not to bust the bad
guys and make them miserable. My job is to protect the innocent people from
injury and wrongs. If to accomplish that I must take action on the bad guy, then
I shall. You never know what tomorrow will bring. You must use this moment to
take care of everyone in all of humanity.

Take a few extra moments out of your day to tell you friends that you appreciate
them. Help out a total stranger without expecting anything in return. It's just
like the Christmas spirit, but use it always. You never know the impact you will
have on someone else's life. You may have caused the death of someone
inadvertantly, and not even know it. You may have saved someone's life and never
have known they were in danger. If you have a depressed co-worker and you just
tell him "Thanks" or ask him/her how his/her day is going, that may make them
feel like somebody cares about them. Knowing that someone cares about you is
often taken for granted, but when you feel like you're all alone, it is a
horrible, terrible feeling...No one should ever feel that way.

I'm sorry if maybe this doesn't seem to flow too well. I was helping a friend
and also sorting through the horrible things I dealt with tonight. I'll perhaps
come back and update this tomorrow and elaborate or re-arrange it. Have a good
night. Please pray for the victim that is in the hospital tonight. She is in
very critical condition. Please also pray for all the emergency responders
world-wide, that God gives them the strength they need to carry on and provide
the neccessary care.

Peace.
