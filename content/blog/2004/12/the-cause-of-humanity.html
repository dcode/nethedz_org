I read an interesting page today. It was titled "[A Soldier's Creed by a Bomber
Pilot][creed]". It is about World War II. The author discusses the reasons of World War
II in relation to the Great War (a.k.a.~ WWI). The author suggests that we
reflect on the last war and re-evaluate our reasons for the current war (WWII).
As they say, history does repeat itself. Although the circumstances are
different, I believe that OIF and OEF is very similar to WWII. Some people
claim that it is a war for money, oil, and greed. I’m sure it is for some
people, but isn't every war? In the page from the bomber pilot, he basically
states that people have different reasons for war. When people say that this
war is about money, they're basically saying that I'm a goon and just doing the
will of my boss to increase his stash. I really don’t like that. I have my own
opinion, and I refuse to become a victim of stupidity.

Word of caution: this is a really long post. (more…)
