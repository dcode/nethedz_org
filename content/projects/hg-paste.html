hg-paste adds an `hg paste` command to Mercurial which can send diffs to
various pastebin websites for easy sharing. You can grab the code from the
[repository][] on BitBucket.

It was inspired by [Pocoo][]'s [hgpaste][pocoopaste] extension, but is
designed to work with public pastebin websites instead of private
installations of [LodgeIt][].

[TOC]

Installing
----------

Clone the repository:

    :::text
    hg clone http://bitbucket.org/sjl/hg-paste/

Edit the `[extensions]` section in your `~/.hgrc` file:

    :::ini
    [extensions]
    paste = (path to)/hg-paste/paste.py

Using the Command
-----------------

To paste a diff of all uncommitted changes in the working directory:

    :::text
    hg paste

To paste the changes that revision `REV` made:

    :::text
    hg paste -r REV

To paste the changes between revisions `REV1` and `REV2`:

    :::text
    hg paste -r REV1:REV2

If any files are specified only those files will be included in the diffs.

Several options can be used to specify more metadata about the paste:

    :::text
    hg paste --user Steve --title 'Progress on feature X' --keep

The pastebin website to use can be specified with `--dest`. Currently only
[dpaste.com](http://dpaste.com/) and [dpaste.org](http://dpaste.org) are
supported.

Questions, Comments, Suggestions
--------------------------------

If you find any bugs, please create an issue in the [issue tracker][issues].
